# Guidelines for Writing Cursor Rules

Use these when creating or editing rule files in `.cursor/rules/`.

## Structure

- **One concern per section**; one idea per bullet. Keep sections focused.
- Group content by context into separate sections with clear headings.
- Prefer **tables** over long lists where a table fits (e.g. path + purpose, field + type).

## Content

- **No overlap** between bullets: related rules can live in the same section, but each bullet states a distinct requirement.
- **Actionable phrasing**: Use imperatives (e.g. "Use…", "Define…", "Avoid…").
- **Concrete clarity**: Include examples, code snippets, or tables where they make the rule unambiguous.
- Avoid repetitiveness; state each requirement once.

## Style

- **Scannable**: Short bullets; **bold** key terms.
- Write like clear internal docs: concise and to the point.
